			i am really sry, but <em id="that_page">that page</em> does not exist and i am so crying and crying about it.

		<p><strong>I'm really awfully sorry about all this</strong></p>

		<p>
			I hope that this
			has not ruined your life. Perhaps a link was out of date. Perhaps
			<strong>*you*</strong> spelt something wrongly. I expect that
			it was that. It's most likely to have been your fault. Regardless of
			how I feel about you, you are error prone. Never really concentrating
			on what you are doing. Always busy chatting away to someone, thinking
			about something else, eating, skipping rope, &amp;c when you could or
			should be clearminded and typing a uri.
		</p>

		<p>
			I'm really very lonely here, sitting in the
			dark writing 404 pages. I'm going to
			do the foolish thing again. I know I'm being
			used but I don't care, I'm sick and sad and idiotic and that is that
			is that. What I'm trying to say is that that page was not found, and
			that I hope this hasn't ruined your day.
