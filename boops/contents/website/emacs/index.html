	<h1>emacs</h1>
<p>when you press a key with a letter on it in emacs, it doesn't put that key on
the screen right away. first it checks what lisp command is bound to that
key. by default, it runs <code>self-insert-command</code>, which inserts the letter you
have pressed into the buffer you're on. you can override this, or any other
keybinding, mouse click, wheel roll with any other command. even commands
you wrote yourself.</p>
<p>there are packages for everything, there's a <a href="http://twmode.sourceforge.net/" title="twittering-mode's homepage">twitter
mode</a>. and there's
a mode<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> for markdown, i'm using
it right now. i've also got a pane at the bottom running the local copy of my
blog server, and a pane over on the right with an embedded webkit pointed at the
server so i can see the article while i write.</p>
<p><img src="https://share.snoot.club/peqax/viyip.png" alt="screenshot of the emacs session described
above"></p>
<p><small>
  <i>it even has devtools.</i>
  <i>i mean it's webkit's devtools but come on still p cool right??</i>
</small></p>
<p>i own <a href="https://shop.fsf.org/books/gnu-emacs-manual-18th-edition-v-261">a paper
copy</a> of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/emacs.html">the
emacs manual</a>,
it's really big. i used it the other day when i was setting up gnus to read my
email in emacs. i also have a copy of a <a href="https://shop.fsf.org/books/signed-introduction-programming-emacs-lisp-3rd-edition">gnu book about emacs
lisp</a>.
it's less big. all the content is available <u>free</u>ly online. it's also built
into the text editor.</p>
<p>if you press <kbd>C-h</kbd><kbd>k</kbd><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> and then any other key, you'll be told what command is bound to that key,
and where that command is defined. <kbd>C-h</kbd><kbd>k</kbd> itself runs the
command <code>describe-key</code>. the <code>C-h</code> prefix also lets you interogate the emacs
process for lots of other kinds of information. If you press
<kbd>C-h</kbd><kbd>?</kbd> it will tell you itself:</p>
<p><details>

<p>everything lives in one lisp session, you can evaluate code and change how the
editor works. you can rewrite functions that are used by other packages.  you
can save that code so it's loaded later, otherwise it'll live only for this
session. you can have subprocesses and terminals and nothing is ever &quot;just the way it
is&quot;, everything can be made to work the way that suits you.</p>
<p>it has the potential to be the smoothest, most streamlined process for
developing code (or editing text at all) in the world. it has the potential to
let you be faster than you could with any other editor. except, because things
are never &quot;just the way it is&quot; it slows me down so much. in any other editor if
i was like &quot;i wish that terminal didn't open all the way across&quot; or whatever,
i'd be like &quot;oh well&quot; but in emacs i'm like &quot;oh let's open up some elisp<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>&quot;.</p>
<p>while i was writing this i got distracted a whole bunch of times. at the top of
all my posts there is a single line of
<a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/">frontmatter</a><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup>. a
variable called &quot;date&quot; that tells the program that builds my blog into html what
date the post was written. as i went to type the date i thought &quot;i shouldn't
have to type this&quot; so i pressed <kbd>M-x</kbd><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup> and went looking for a function to insert a date. then i googled<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup> &quot;emacs insert date&quot; and &quot;elisp current date&quot;. i read some docs.</p>
<p>i pressed <kbd>M-:</kbd> <i>(this is the command &quot;<code>eval-expression</code>&quot; which lets
you run some run some lisp and see the result)</i></p>
<p>i typed <code>(insert-string (format-time-string &quot;%FT%H:%M:%SZ&quot;))</code></p>
<p>it seemed to work, so then i pressed:</p>
<p><kbd>s-p</kbd> <i>(my <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile">projectile</a> prefix binding)</i></p>
<p><kbd>p</kbd> <i>(lets me select one of my projects)</i></p>
<p><code>emacs.d</code> <kbd>f</kbd> <code>chee/util</code> <i>(to open up my <code>util.el</code> file)</i></p>
<p>and added this:</p>
<pre class="language-lisp"><code class="language-lisp"><span class="highlight-line"><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token car">defun</span> insert-time <span class="token boolean">nil</span></span><br><span class="highlight-line">  <span class="token string">"Insert the current time in the format used in contents's frontmatter!"</span></span><br><span class="highlight-line">  <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token interactive keyword">interactive</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></span><br><span class="highlight-line">  <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token car">insert-string</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token car">format-time-string</span> <span class="token string">"%FT%H:%M:%SZ"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>now i can press <kbd>M-x</kbd> <code>insert-time</code> <kbd>RET</kbd> and it puts the time
in just like it should. this was 5 minutes spent before i'd even gotten to the
title.</p>
<p>i started the post. i like to keep my markdown files hard-wrapped at 80 columns
so they look nice when you run <code>cat post.md</code> on a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_terminal#Text_terminals">teletype</a>. and
in a normal text editor i'd write a paragraph and then highlight it and tell it
to &quot;reflow text&quot;, or i'd do it by hand. but emacs has <code>auto-fill-mode</code>, a minor
mode for exactly this purpose. (when you go over the limit (set to 80 columns by
default) it adds a newline before the previous word).</p>
<p>so:</p>
<p><kbd>M-x</kbd> <code>auto-fill-mode</code></p>
<p>type some more, neat it works. let's make sure that happens every time:</p>
<p><kbd>s-p</kbd><kbd>p</kbd> <code>emacs.d</code> <kbd>f</kbd> <code>config.d/init-markdown-mode.el</code></p>
<pre class="language-lisp"><code class="language-lisp"><span class="highlight-line"><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token car">add-hook</span> <span class="token quoted-symbol variable symbol">'markdown-mode-hook</span> <span class="token quoted-symbol variable symbol">#'auto-fill-mode</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>this means <code>auto-fill-mode</code> will come on automatically any time i've activated
markdown mode.</p>
<p>anyway, eventually i wrote the post. but i started at 9:29pm and now it's
0:57am and like wtf you know.</p>
<p>oh, should the post time be the time i started or the time i finished? should i
generate the time when a post first appears and then store that out of band??</p>

<li id="fn1" class="footnote-item"><p>emacs has this concept of modes. there is always a current &quot;major mode&quot;
and any number of &quot;minor modes&quot;. the modes are definitions of what different
keys do and commands that run at different times. your major-mode will be
whatever the language is you're writing in (rust, lisp, markdown, text etc) and
the minor modes will take care of things like linting. <a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>

<li id="fn2" class="footnote-item"><p>this notation means <code>Ctrl+H H</code>.  <code>M-a</code>
would mean <code>Meta</code> and <code>a</code>. Meta means alt/option. <code>s-p</code> is <code>super</code> and
<code>p</code>. Super means command, or the windows key. emacs is older than all the normal
words for things. cut and paste are called kill and yank. i don't know when we
agreed on all the normal names for things, but back when emacs was invented it
was all still pretty psychedelic. a few years later when the folks at bell labs
made <a href="https://9p.io/plan9/index.html">plan9</a> they called copy &quot;snarf&quot;. i don't
