	<h1>fosdem 2017</h1>
<p>on the flight back now from fosdem 2017. it was a good time, drinks were had, i
tried club mate for the first time and met some fine people. i managed to miss
every talk i'd wanted to see, but it was certainly worth while. last night i met
a man called stu who was in brussels on his stag do, he'd fallen over the night
before and smashed out his two front teeth head-butting the pavement. then
yesterday morning at 8am he found his teeth on the street.</p>
<p>i'll probably be joining the belfast hackerspace when i get home. one thing
i've learnt from fosdem is that looking around and on every computer screen
seeing a full screen terminal is good for the soul. it's also soothing
to be surrounded by a bunch of nerds who use computer metaphors to talk about
people, and who understand that taking a computer out at a party does
not mean you are not still at the party</p>
<p>on saturday night there was an after party at a hackerspace that was like the
club scene from the start of the matrix. at any moment it seemed that someone
with a white rabbit tattoo would walk in. angelina jolie was there and i
admitted i'd been <code>zero_cool</code> all along. it was like where Hollywood
thinks hackers hang out. they've been right this whole
time</p>
<p>11/10 gg belgium would belg again</p>
